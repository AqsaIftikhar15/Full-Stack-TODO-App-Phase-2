command: "/sp.specify Todo Chatbot Web Application – Phase V.1: Intermediate & Advanced Features (Extension of Existing System – Full Stack) Target: Extend the EXISTING Todo Chatbot web application (frontend and backend) built in Phases II–IV by adding all Intermediate and Advanced features end-to-end. All changes MUST: - Be additive only - Preserve the existing project structure - Remain backward-compatible with the current codebase, APIs, database schema, and deployment setup No restructuring, rewriting, or creation of a new project is allowed. --- Primary Objective: Enhance the existing system by implementing all Intermediate and Advanced Todo features across: - Backend business logic - REST APIs - Frontend UI - Frontend ↔ Backend API fetching and state updates Every feature MUST: - Exist in backend logic - Be exposed via REST APIs - Be visible, usable, and interactable in the frontend UI --- ### NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES - ❌ No new project or repository - ❌ No architectural rewrites - ❌ No breaking changes to existing APIs - ❌ No backend-only implementations - ✅ Only extend existing modules, routes, models, and UI components - ✅ All features must appear in the UI and work end-to-end --- ### FEATURES TO BUILD (IN SCOPE) ## INTERMEDIATE FEATURES (Frontend + Backend + UI) 1. Task Priorities - Extend existing Task model with `priority` field (low / medium / high) - Backend: validation, filtering, sorting - Frontend UI: - Priority selector when creating/editing tasks - Visual priority indicators in task list - REST APIs (extend existing endpoints): - POST /tasks - PUT /tasks/{task_id} - GET /tasks?priority= --- 2. Tags / Labels - Extend Task model to support multiple tags - Backend: tagging logic and filtering - Frontend UI: - Add/remove tags - Display tags as badges - REST APIs: - POST /tasks - PUT /tasks/{task_id} - GET /tasks?tag= --- 3. Search - Backend: extend task listing logic to support keyword search - Frontend UI: - Search input field - Live or triggered search results - REST API: - GET /tasks/search?q= --- 4. Filter - Backend: filtering by status, priority, and tags - Frontend UI: - Filter controls (dropdowns / checkboxes) - REST API: - GET /tasks?status=&priority=&tag= --- 5. Sort - Backend: sorting by created date, due date, priority - Frontend UI: - Sort dropdown or toggle - REST API: - GET /tasks?sort_by=&order= --- ## ADVANCED FEATURES (Frontend + Backend + UI) 6. Due Dates - Extend Task model with `due_date` - Backend: date validation and storage - Frontend UI: - Date picker during create/edit - Display due date in task list - REST APIs: - POST /tasks - PUT /tasks/{task_id} --- 7. Reminders (Logical Only – No Kafka/Dapr Yet) - Extend task logic with reminder metadata - Backend: reminder configuration and validation (no async processing yet) - Frontend UI: - Reminder configuration (time before due date) - REST APIs: - POST /tasks/{task_id}/reminder - GET /tasks/{task_id}/reminder --- 8. Recurring Tasks - Extend task lifecycle with recurrence rules (daily / weekly / interval) - Backend: synchronous recurrence logic - Frontend UI: - Recurrence configuration controls - REST APIs: - POST /tasks/{task_id}/recurrence - GET /tasks/{task_id}/recurrence --- 9. Task Completion Lifecycle - Extend existing task status handling - Backend: enforce valid transitions - Frontend UI: - Complete and archive actions - REST APIs: - PUT /tasks/{task_id}/complete - PUT /tasks/{task_id}/archive --- 10. Activity / Audit Log (Application Level) - Track create, update, complete, delete operations - Backend: activity log model linked to Task - Frontend UI: - Activity timeline per task - REST API: - GET /tasks/{task_id}/activity --- ### API DESIGN REQUIREMENTS - All frontend interactions MUST use REST APIs - Extend existing endpoints; do not introduce parallel APIs - Maintain backward compatibility - Follow existing request/response patterns - Pagination, filtering, and sorting must reuse current conventions --- ### DOMAIN MODEL EXTENSIONS Extend existing models only: - Task - priority - tags - due_date - recurrence metadata - reminder metadata - ActivityLog (new, but linked to Task) Each extension must define: - Field additions - Validation rules - Default values for existing records --- ### FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS - All Intermediate and Advanced features MUST be visible in the UI - Extend existing screens and components only - No new frontend application - Frontend must: - Fetch data via REST APIs - Handle loading, success, and error states - Reflect real-time updates from backend responses --- ### BACKEND REQUIREMENTS - Extend existing services, routers, and handlers - No logic duplication - Business rules stay centralized in backend - APIs must be designed to be event-ready for Phase V.2 (Kafka + Dapr) --- ### NOT BUILDING (OUT OF SCOPE) - Kafka or message brokers - Dapr integration - Minikube or Kubernetes changes - CI/CD pipelines - Cloud deployment - Monitoring and logging infrastructure --- ### CONSTRAINTS - No manual coding - Specification only - Changes must be additive and reversible - Must support seamless transition to Phase V.2 --- ### SUCCESS CRITERIA - All Intermediate and Advanced features implemented end-to-end - Features are visible, usable, and testable in the frontend UI - Frontend and backend remain fully synchronized - No regression or breaking changes - System is ready for event-driven refactor in Phase V.2"
