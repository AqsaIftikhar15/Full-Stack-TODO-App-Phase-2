prompt_text: "Todo Chatbot Web Application – Phase V.1: Intermediate & Advanced Features (Extension of Existing System – Full Stack) Target: Extend the EXISTING Todo Chatbot web application (frontend and backend) built in Phases II–IV by adding all Intermediate and Advanced features end-to-end. All changes MUST: - Be additive only - Preserve the existing project structure - Remain backward-compatible with the current codebase, APIs, database schema, and deployment setup No restructuring, rewriting, or creation of a new project is allowed. --- Primary Objective: Enhance the existing system by implementing all Intermediate and Advanced Todo features across: - Backend business logic - REST APIs - Frontend UI - Frontend ↔ Backend API fetching and state updates Every feature MUST: - Exist in backend logic - Be exposed via REST APIs - Be visible, usable, and interactable in the frontend UI --- ### NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES - ❌ No new project or repository - ❌ No architectural rewrites - ❌ No breaking changes to existing APIs - ❌ No backend-only implementations - ✅ Only extend existing modules, routes, models, and UI components - ✅ All features must appear in the UI and work end-to-end --- ### FEATURES TO BUILD (IN SCOPE) ## INTERMEDIATE FEATURES (Frontend + Backend + UI) 1. Task Priorities - Extend existing Task model with `priority` field (low / medium / high) - Backend: validation, filtering, sorting - Frontend UI: - Priority selector when creating/editing tasks - Visual priority indicators in task list - REST APIs (extend existing endpoints): - POST /tasks - PUT /tasks/{task_id} - GET /tasks?priority= --- 2. Tags / Labels - Extend Task model to support multiple tags - Backend: tagging logic and filtering - Frontend UI: - Add/remove tags - Display tags as badges - REST APIs: - POST /tasks - PUT /tasks/{task_id} - GET /tasks?tag= --- 3. Search - Backend: extend task listing logic to support keyword search - Frontend UI: - Search input field - Live or triggered search results - REST API: - GET /tasks/search?q= --- 4. Filter - Backend: filtering by status, priority, and tags - Frontend UI: - Filter controls (dropdowns / checkboxes) - REST API: - GET /tasks?status=&priority=&tag= --- 5. Sort - Backend: sorting by created date, due date, priority - Frontend UI: - Sort dropdown or toggle - REST API: - GET /tasks?sort_by=&order= --- ## ADVANCED FEATURES (Frontend + Backend + UI) 6. Due Dates - Extend Task model with `due_date` - Backend: date validation and storage - Frontend UI: - Date picker during create/edit - Display due date in task list - REST APIs: - POST /tasks - PUT /tasks/{task_id} --- 7. Reminders (Logical Only – No Kafka/Dapr Yet) - Extend task logic with reminder metadata - Backend: reminder configuration and validation (no async processing yet) - Frontend UI: - Reminder configuration (time before due date) - REST APIs: - POST /tasks/{task_id}/reminder - GET /tasks/{task_id}/reminder --- 8. Recurring Tasks - Extend task lifecycle with recurrence rules (daily / weekly / interval) - Backend: synchronous recurrence logic - Frontend UI: - Recurrence configuration controls - REST APIs: - POST /tasks/{task_id}/recurrence - GET /tasks/{task_id}/recurrence --- 9. Task Completion Lifecycle - Extend existing task status handling - Backend: enforce valid transitions - Frontend UI: - Complete and archive actions - REST APIs: - PUT /tasks/{task_id}/complete - PUT /tasks/{task_id}/archive --- 10. Activity / Audit Log (Application Level) - Track create, update, complete, delete operations - Backend: activity log model linked to Task - Frontend UI: - Activity timeline per task - REST API: - GET /tasks/{task_id}/activity --- ### API DESIGN REQUIREMENTS - All frontend interactions MUST use REST APIs - Extend existing endpoints; do not introduce parallel APIs - Maintain backward compatibility - Follow existing request/response patterns - Pagination, filtering, and sorting must reuse current conventions --- ### DOMAIN MODEL EXTENSIONS Extend existing models only: - Task - priority - tags - due_date - recurrence metadata - reminder metadata - ActivityLog (new, but linked to Task) Each extension must define: - Field additions - Validation rules - Default values for existing records --- ### FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS - All Intermediate and Advanced features MUST be visible in the UI - Extend existing screens and components only - No new frontend application - Frontend must: - Fetch data via REST APIs - Handle loading, success, and error states - Reflect real-time updates from backend responses --- ### BACKEND REQUIREMENTS - Extend existing services, routers, and handlers - No logic duplication - Business rules stay centralized in backend - APIs must be designed to be event-ready for Phase V.2 (Kafka + Dapr) --- ### NOT BUILDING (OUT OF SCOPE) - Kafka or message brokers - Dapr integration - Minikube or Kubernetes changes - CI/CD pipelines - Cloud deployment - Monitoring and logging infrastructure --- ### CONSTRAINTS - No manual coding - Specification only - Changes must be additive and reversible - Must support seamless transition to Phase V.2 --- ### SUCCESS CRITERIA - All Intermediate and Advanced features implemented end-to-end - Features are visible, usable, and testable in the frontend UI - Frontend and backend remain fully synchronized - No regression or breaking changes - System is ready for event-driven refactor in Phase V.2"
response_text: "Completed implementation planning for Todo Advanced Features, including: 1) Research findings on technology stack and implementation approaches 2) Detailed data model extensions with validation rules 3) Comprehensive API contracts for all new and extended endpoints 4) Architecture extension sketch with component mapping 5) Frontend UI extension planning 6) Implementation approach for both backend and frontend 7) Validation and testing strategy 8) Phase V.2 readiness considerations for agent integration. All artifacts created in specs/005-todo-advanced-features/: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/todo-advanced-features.yaml."
outcome: "Complete implementation plan created with all required artifacts for developing the advanced features while maintaining backward compatibility and preparing for future agent integration"
evaluation: "The plan comprehensively addresses all requested features while adhering to the constraints of additive changes and backward compatibility. The architecture extension maintains the existing system structure while adding the new functionality. The API contracts and data models are well-defined and ready for implementation."
