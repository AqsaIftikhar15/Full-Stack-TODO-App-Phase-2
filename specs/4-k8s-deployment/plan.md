# Implementation Plan: Phase IV – Local Kubernetes Deployment of Cloud-Native Todo Chatbot

**Branch**: `4-k8s-deployment` | **Date**: 2026-01-29 | **Spec**: [specs/4-k8s-deployment/spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/4-k8s-deployment/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Deploy the Phase III Todo Chatbot (frontend and backend) onto a local Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts, with all containerization and Kubernetes operations executed through AI-assisted DevOps tools. The implementation will leverage Docker AI Agent (Gordon) for containerization, kubectl-ai for Kubernetes operations, and kagent for cluster analysis, ensuring all infrastructure artifacts are generated through AI assistance without manual coding.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: N/A (Infrastructure deployment)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docker AI Agent (Gordon), kubectl-ai, kagent, Minikube, Helm
**Storage**: External Neon PostgreSQL database (accessed via connection string)
**Testing**: Kubernetes health checks, NodePort accessibility validation
**Target Platform**: Local Minikube Kubernetes cluster
**Project Type**: Infrastructure/deployment
**Performance Goals**: Standard development resources (0.5 CPU, 512MB RAM per container)
**Constraints**: No manual Dockerfile or Kubernetes YAML creation; AI-assisted tooling only; Minikube-only deployment
**Scale/Scope**: Single local deployment with frontend and backend services

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [X] Spec-Driven Development: Following specification in spec.md
- [X] Agentic Dev Stack Workflow: Using ContainerAgent, KubernetesAgent, AIOpsAgent
- [X] Technology Stack Compliance: Using Docker AI (Gordon), kubectl-ai, kagent as required
- [X] Container-First Deployment: Docker images created via Gordon-assisted workflows
- [X] Kubernetes-First Deployment: Using Minikube and Helm Charts as required
- [X] AI-Assisted DevOps Operations: Using kubectl-ai and kagent for operations
- [X] Container-First Architecture: Docker AI Agent (Gordon) as primary tool
- [X] Zero Manual Coding: No handwritten Dockerfiles, YAML, or scripts

All constitutional requirements are satisfied.

**Structure Decision**: Infrastructure deployment structure with Dockerfiles generated by Docker AI Agent (Gordon) and Kubernetes manifests managed through Helm charts as required by the constitution and spec.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Multiple Helm charts | Separate management of frontend/backend | Combined chart would reduce flexibility and violate microservice principles |
